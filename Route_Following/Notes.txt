Here are the notes for future developers:



### How to define the streets to follow and ignore grass and plants:
- To define the walkable areas and prevent the player to walk through hecken and grass etc., I used NavMesh.
- I created an empty game object and named it NavMesh. In that game object, I added a NavMeshSurface. 
	- it was humanoid and walkable.
	- this was not enough to exclude the grass and hecken.
- Next, I opened relief_vertieft object in the inspector and I added a component "NavMeshModifier".
	I clikced "override area" and chose 'not walkable' area type.
- Then, I opened NavMesh game object and clicked "bake" in the inspector.
